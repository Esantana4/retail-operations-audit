Retail Operations Audit — Margin & Discount Analysis
Objective

Audit retail performance to determine true profitability, evaluate discount effectiveness, and identify margin risks masked by revenue-driven reporting.

Business Questions

Which stores are truly profitable?

Are discounts helping or hurting margins?

Which product categories subsidize the business?

Where are leadership decisions eroding profitability?

Dataset

Simulated retail sales data

15 orders across 4 stores

Includes revenue, cost, discount, profit, margin, employee, and product category data

Analytical Workflow

The Excel workbook reflects a complete end-to-end analysis:

Raw_Data – original sales records

Cleaned_Data – validated, standardized, and enriched data

Pivots – KPI aggregation by store, category, discount status, and employee

Dashboard – executive-level KPI visualization

Key KPIs

Total Profit

Profit Margin

Profit per Order

Discounted vs Full-Price Margin

Category Profit Contribution

Key Findings

All stores are profitable, but the North store generates the highest profit with the fewest orders, indicating superior efficiency.

Add-ons subsidize the business, delivering consistently high margins even when discounted.

Discounts improve Add-on profitability but significantly reduce Electronics margins, particularly for laptops.

Revenue alone overstates performance and obscures margin risk.

Discounting is applied uniformly without regard to product-level cost structure.

Recommendations

Implement margin-based discount guardrails.

Restrict discounts on low-margin Electronics.

Shift sales emphasis toward high-margin Add-ons.

Replace revenue-only reporting with profit-centric KPIs.

Limitations

Small dataset limits statistical confidence.

Results are directional and intended to demonstrate analytical reasoning.
