Key Findings

All stores are profitable, but North store generates the highest profit with the fewest orders, indicating superior efficiency.

Add-ons subsidize the business, delivering high margins even when discounted.

Discounting helps Add-ons but damages Electronics margins, especially laptops.

Revenue alone is a misleading success metric — margin-based KPIs reveal operational risk.

Discounting is applied uniformly without regard to product-level margin sensitivity.

Limitations

Small dataset limits statistical confidence.

Results are directional and intended to demonstrate analytical reasoning rather than forecasting accuracy.

Recommendations

Introduce margin-based discount guardrails.

Reduce or restrict discounts on low-margin Electronics.

Shift sales focus toward high-margin Add-ons.

Track profit-centric KPIs instead of revenue-only metrics.

Tools Used
